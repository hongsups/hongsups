### Hi there üëã

I'm Hongsup/ÌôçÏÑ≠ and I am an ML practitioner in Austin, TX. Currenty I work as a Principal ML Research Engineer at Arm. Until recently, I also volunteered at Texas Justice Initiative, a local criminal justice non-profit in Austin. My background is computational neuroscience (PhD) and behavioral ecology (MSc). When it comes to ML, I am interested in ML Ops, AI ethics, and responsible AI. Feel free to reach out to me via hongsup.shin@pm.me, [my blog](https://hongsupshin.github.io/), or [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hongsupshin/). Oh btw, I am a native speaker of Korean. :)
